### How It Works

Server is written in Java and runs on MySQL. Client is inside the Vue/Src/Evolvee_Client folder where you can use NPM commands to start the client. Outer folder layer is for Starport, Cosmos SDK, and this is built on top of the planet template.  

For the MySQL part I recommend using MySQL Workbench, and when it comes to Java, Rust and the others VS code works just fine on it's own.
